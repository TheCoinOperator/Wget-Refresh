# Wget-Refresh
this is a simple bash script to refresh to the latest version of an app to be referenced by a website.

This script is currently set up for communicator which is a softphone but the actual app itself isnt that important, a generic version would certainly be possible.

As would a version that asks for each individual line though that seems fairly useless i would admit.

It is written as a bash script so as to not have to install a bunch of extra imports to make a python shell work even if that would have greater flexibility.

I hope the comments in the actual code illuminate each section well enough as this is a one file script that without spaces and comments would be under 20 lines

this isnt designed to be used in any larger projects its just to automate one task i do fairly often, but if you think it would help you please use it but let me know and credit me thanks.
